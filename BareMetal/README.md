# BareMetal
This is a little OS that I'm writing for Raspberry Pi 3, as I attempt to follow
[this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/raspberry-pi-write-your-own-operating-system-step-by-step).

## Setup instruction
- Download GCC cross compiler toolchain from https://thinkski.github.io/osx-arm-linux-toolchains/
- Install Qemu in order to test without a real Raspberry Pi:
```
brew install qemu
```
